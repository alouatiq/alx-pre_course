# 0x01. Git

## Description
This repository contains exercises and tasks related to learning Git version control. Each task focuses on different aspects of Git usage, including repository setup, branching, merging, collaboration, and best practices.

## Project Requirements
- Use of command line for Git operations (except where web UI is explicitly necessary).
- All answers should only contain the command, with no additional text.
- Includes a README.md file at the root of the `alx-pre_course` repo.
- Includes a README.md file in the `0x01-git` directory describing the project.
- Avoid pushing unnecessary files to the repository.
- Follow instructions to create branches, merge conflicts, and manage project changes.

## Concepts Covered
- Source code management basics.
- Git fundamentals: commits, branches, merging.
- GitHub usage: repository creation, collaboration, pull requests.
- Differences between Git and GitHub.
- Writing good commit messages and READMEs.
- Handling conflicts and branching strategies.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- The purpose of source code management.
- Fundamental Git operations and concepts.
- Effective use of GitHub for collaboration.
- Best practices for writing commits and READMEs.
- Resolving conflicts and managing branches.

## Tasks Overview
1. **Create and setup your Git and GitHub account**
   - Create GitHub account, setup access token, update profile, create repository, clone and push.

2. **Repo-session**
   - Create `0x01-git` directory with README.md, commit and push.

3. **Coding fury road**
   - Create directories and files (`c/c_is_fun.c`, `js/main.js`, `js/index.js`, `bash/alx`, `bash/school`), add to Git, commit, and push.

4. **Collaboration is the base of a company**
   - Create branch `update_script`, modify files, commit, push; switch to main, update file, delete directory, commit, push.

5. **Collaboration: be up to date**
   - Update README.md via GitHub UI, pull changes locally, create `up_to_date` file with command used, add to Git, commit, push.

6. **HAAA what did you do???**
   - Merge branch `update_script` to main, resolve conflicts, push changes.

7. **Never push too much**
   - Create `.gitignore` to ignore Emacs ~ files.

## Files and Directories
Each task corresponds to specific directories and files within the project structure:
- `0x01-git/`: Contains directories `bash`, `c`, `js` and specific files as mentioned in tasks.

## Usage
- Clone the repository.
- Navigate through directories and files as instructed in each task.
- Use Git commands to perform operations as required.
- Follow branching and merging strategies described in tasks.
